# Recommender-System  
**Four different types of recommenders were created:**    
  
* Simple Recommender: Based on the IMDB weighted rating system.  
* Content Based Recommender: Uses metadata about movies(genre, cast, taglines) to generate recommendations.  
* Collaborative Filtering: Uses the taste of similar users to provide recommendations.  
* Hybrid Recommender: Uses both content and collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalised recommendations for a user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.
